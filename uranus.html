        Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun in the Solar System. It is an ice giant as Neptune. It is the third largest planet in the solar system. The planet is made of ice, gases and liquid metal. Its atmosphere contains hydrogen (1H),
         helium (2He) and methane. The temperature on Uranus is −197 °C (−322.6 °F; 76.1 K) near the top of its atmosphere, but its small solid core (about 55% the mass of Earth) is probably about 4,730 °C (8,540 °F; 5,000 K).The planet is tilted on <br>
          its axis so much that it is sideways.[21] It has five big moons, many small ones, and a small system of 13 planetary rings. <br>
