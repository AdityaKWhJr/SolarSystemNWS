        Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun located in the Solar System. It is the second largest planet in the Solar System, after Jupiter. Saturn is one of the four gas giant planets, along with Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune.<br>
        Saturn is the English transliteration from the Latin word Saturnus, in Roman religion, the god of sowing or seed. The Romans equated him with the Greek agricultural deity Kronos. Saturn was named after the Roman god Saturnus (called Kronos in Greek mythology).<br>
        Inside Saturn is probably a core of iron, nickel, silicon and oxygen compounds, surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, then a layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium and finally, an outer gaseous layer. <br>
        Saturn has 82 known moons orbiting the planet. 53 are officially named and 29 are waiting to be named.The largest moon is Titan, which is larger in volume than the planet Mercury. Titan is the second-largest moon in the Solar System.<br>
        The largest moon is Jupiter's moon, Ganymede. There is also a very large system of rings around Saturn. These rings are made of ice with smaller amounts of rocks and dust. Some people believe that the rings were caused by a moon impact or other event.<br>
