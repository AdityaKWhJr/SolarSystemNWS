        <p style="color: white;font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;font-size: larger;"> Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System. It is the closest planet to the sun. It makes one trip around the Sun once every 87 days. Mercury is bright when we can see it from Earth. <br>
            It cannot be seen easily because it is usually too close to the Sun. Because of this, Mercury can only be seen in the morning or evening. Less is known about Mercury than about other planets of our Solar System. Even with telescopes only a small, bright crescent can be seen. It is also hard to put a satellite in orbit around it.<br>
            Mercury looks like Earth's Moon. It has many craters and smooth plains. It has no moons and no atmosphere as we know it. However, Mercury does have an extremely thin atmosphere, known as an exosphere. SCROLL BELOW. </p>
