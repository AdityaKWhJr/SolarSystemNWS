            Earth is the third planet of the solar system. It is the only planet known to have life on it. The Earth formed around 4.5 billion years ago. It is one of four rocky planets on the inside of the Solar System.<br>
            The large mass of the Sun keeps the Earth in orbit, just as the mass of Earth keeps the moon moving around it. Earth also turns around in space, so that different parts face the Sun at different times. Earth <br>
             goes around the Sun once (one year) for every 365​1⁄4 times it turns around. Because of its water, Earth is home to millions of species of plants and animals which require water to survive. <br>
             The things that live on Earth have changed its surface greatly. For example, early cyanobacteria changed the air and gave it oxygen. The living part of Earth's surface is called the "biosphere".<br>
